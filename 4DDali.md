# Solution to the 4D equivalent of the Dali cross

How to tile 3D space using the Dali Cross has already been shown [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02086.pdf). With the 4D equivalent I'm referring to the 3D version where the block covered on all sides in 3D has an additional block attached each side along the fourth dimension.

## Notes on the visiualisation

As many solution on [WHUTS](https://whuts.org/) I too have used [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net) for quikly building block structures in 3D. To visualize 4D shapes we will need to look at different cuts for the 4D tiling. In the following images concerete and wool was used for the crosses and glass serves as a marker for intentional gaps. We will first tile 3D space using the regular 3D Dali cross while leaving some gaps. At the same time we will look at what effect this has one unit along the fourth dimension. And finally we will look at how we can combine the 3D tilings with gaps and blocks sticking out to tile 4D space.
